## Welcome to Sequencer
Sequencer is a simple app to generate the five possible sequences of English letters from words and phrases or names you enter.

You can see it at : [Sequencer](https://kathyonu.github.io/ "Textual Sequencer")

> After you arrive, enter your text into the entry box,
> when you tab or click out of the entry box, the various sequences
> will be generated and entered into their display boxes,
> without page change, using javascript with jQuery.
