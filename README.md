## Welcome to Sequencer
Sequencer is a simple app to generate various sequences of that which you enter.

You can see it at : [Sequencer](http://kathyonu.github.com/ "Textual Sequencers")

> After you arrive, enter your text into the entry box,
> when you tab or click out of the entry box, the various sequences
> will be generated and entered into their display boxes,
> without page change, using javascript with jQuery.

This Sequencer was a first tiny slice of a much larger application at :  [Sequencers](http://www.goodworksonearth.net "Sequencers")

> An anagrams generator is available now at [Wordsmith AnagramGenerator](http://www.wordsmith.org/ "Wordsmith.org AnagramGenerator")
